# Image Classification Side Project

Using this dataset from Kaggle [Tom and Jerry Image classification](kaggle.com/datasets/balabaskar/tom-and-jerry) to have a try at image classification, do take in mind that this is a side project, meaning I probably won't fully commit to make it easily accessible and usable.

The dataset can be automatically downloaded using the Kaggle API by running this script [Download Dataset]()
